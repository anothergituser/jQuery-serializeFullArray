# SerializeFullArray

SerializeFullArray is a plugin for jQuery that provides an object (ie: associative array) representation of a form, taking into account input arrays.

The usefulness of this is in forms where javascript needs to change form behaviour dependant on values, hiding and showing sections of arrays.

SerializeFullArray is also useful as an example of recursive array building without actual recursion, by using references.
